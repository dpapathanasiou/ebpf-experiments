# About

These are my initial experiments in [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/), inspired by [Liz Rice](http://www.lizrice.com/)'s [Beginner's Guide to eBPF](https://github.com/lizrice/ebpf-beginners), using [BPF Compiler Collection (BCC)](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) on a [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) image running in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (to prevent any accidental kernel damage)

# Installation

After [installing Debian images to run on VirtualBox](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=debian+on+virtualbox), [install BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md#debian---binary) on the image running there, and clone this repo
