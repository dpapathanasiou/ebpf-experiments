# About

These are my initial experiments in [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/), inspired by [Liz Rice](http://www.lizrice.com/)'s [Beginner's Guide to eBPF](https://github.com/lizrice/ebpf-beginners), using [BPF Compiler Collection (BCC)](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) on an [Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) image with [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) running in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
